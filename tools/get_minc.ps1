# get_minc.ps1 — download a pinned minc compiler release.

# minc is the language thirteen-minc is written in. It's a separate
# **closed-source** binary distributed from
# https://github.com/SpacesOfPlay/minc-dev/releases — see LICENSE.md
# at the top of this repo for the disclosure.
#
# This script fetches the pinned version, verifies its SHA-256, and
# extracts to `tools/minc/` (gitignored). `build.ps1` picks it up
# automatically — no PATH changes needed.
#
# To rotate: bump $MincVersion and $MincSha256Win below, re-run.
# A SHA-256 mismatch aborts the script.
